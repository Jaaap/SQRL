# SQRL

## Secure Quick Reliable Login by Steve Gibson over at https://grc.com/sqrl
This is a WebExtension for Chrome and Firefox that enables logging into SQRL-enabled webservers.

## How to use?
While in development, you can clone or download this WebExtension, then ...

For **Chrome** go to chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode" and then "Load unpacked extension...". Point it to the root of the SQRL folder/dir you just created.

For **Firefox**, first create an xpi file with a command like `cd SQRL; zip -r SQRL.xpi *` then open FireFox Developer Edition (normal Firefox will not work), go to about:config, search for xpinstall.signatures.required and set it to false, then go to about:addons, Click on the gear icon (âš™) pulldown, click "Install Addon From File..." and open the SQRL.xpi file.
